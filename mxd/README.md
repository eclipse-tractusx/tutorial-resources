# Minimum Tractus-X Dataspace

## 1. Prerequisites

In order to run the Minimum Tractus-X Dataspace "MXD" on your local machine, please make sure the following
preconditions are met.

- Have a local Kubernetes runtime ready. We've tested this setup with [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), but other
  runtimes such
  as [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) may work as well, we just haven't tested them. All following
  instructions will assume KinD.
- Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).
- a POSIX-compliant shell, e.g. `bash` or `zsh` unless stated otherwise
- basic knowledge about Helm and Kubernetes
- [Optional] a cli tool to easily print logs of a K8S deployment, such as [`stern`](https://github.com/stern/stern)
- [Optional] a graphical tool to inspect your Kubernetes environment, such as [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/).
  Not mandatory of course, but all screenshots in this doc are created off of Lens.
- [Optional] a graphical tool to inspect Postgres databases, such as [PgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/). Screenshots in
  this guide are created off of PgAdmin.
- [Optional] a graphical tool to send REST requests, such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). This sample will
  include Postman collections that can be imported.

## 2. Basic dataspace setup

The "MXD" dataspace initially consists of several components: `Alice` and `Bob` (two Tractus-X EDC connectors),
a `vault` instance each, a Postgres database, a Managed Identity Wallet app, a Keycloak instance. `Alice` and `Bob` will
be our dataspace participants. Each of them stores their secrets in their "private" vault instance, and there is a
shared Postgres server, where each of them has a database. MIW and Keycloak are "central" components, they only exist
once and are accessible by all participants.

For the most bare-bones installation of the dataspace, execute the following commands in a shell:

```shell
cd <path/of/mxd/backend-service>
./gradlew clean dockerize
# firstly go to the folder containing the config files
cd <path/of/mxd>
kind create cluster -n mxd --config kind.config.yaml
# the next step is specific to KinD and will be different for other Kubernetes runtimes!
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/main/deploy/static/provider/kind/deploy.yaml
# wait until the ingress controller is ready
kubectl wait --namespace ingress-nginx \
  --for=condition=ready pod \
  --selector=app.kubernetes.io/component=controller \
  --timeout=90s
kind load docker-image --name mxd backend-service:1.0.0
terraform init
terraform apply
# type "yes" and press enter when prompted to do so 
```

Notice that the `kubectl apply` command deploys a Kubernetes Ingress Controller to the cluster and is required to reach
our applications from outside the cluster. Specifically, it deploys an NGINX ingress controller. Notice also, that the
command is *specific to KinD* and will likely not work on other Kubernetes runtimes (minikube, ...) or with other
ingress controllers!

Wait. Then wait some more. It will take a couple of minutes until all services are booted up. If your machine is a
potato, it'll take even longer. Just get a coffee. Eventually, it should look similar to this:

### Inspect terraform output

After the `terraform` command has successfully completed, it will output a few configuration and setup values
that we will need in later steps. Please note that most values will be different on your local system.

```shell
Outputs:

alice-urls = {
  "health" = "http://localhost/alice/health"
  "management" = "http://localhost/alice/management/v2"
}
bob-node-ip = "10.96.248.22"
bob-urls = {
  "health" = "http://localhost/bob/health"
  "management" = "http://localhost/bob/management/v2"
}
connector1-aeskey = "R3BDWGF4SWFYZigmVj0oIQ=="
connector1-client-secret = "W3s1OikqRkxCbltfNDBmRg=="
connector2-aeskey = "JHJISjZAS0tSKlNYajJTZA=="
connector2-client-secret = "enFFUlkwQyZiJSRLQSohYg=="
keycloak-database-credentials = {
  "database" = "miw"
  "password" = "Tn*iwPEuCgO@d==R"
  "user" = "miw_user"
}
keycloak-ip = "10.96.103.80"
miw-database-pwd = {
  "database" = "keycloak"
  "password" = "W:z)*mnHdy(DTV?+"
  "user" = "keycloak_user"
}
postgres-url = "jdbc:postgresql://10.96.195.240:5432/"
```

### Inspect the databases

Please be aware, that all services and applications that were deployed in the previous step, are **not** accessible from
outside the Kubernetes cluster. That means, for example, the Postgres database cannot be reached out-of-the-box.

Naturally there are several ways to enable access to those services (Load balancers, Ingresses, etc.) but for the sake
of simplicity we will use a plain Kubernetes port-forwarding:

```shell
kubectl port-forward postgres-5b788f6bdd-bvt9b 5432:5432
``` 

> Note that the actual pod name will be slightly different in your local cluster.

Then, using PgAdmin, connect to the Postgres server at `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/` using `user=postgres`
and `password=postgres`:

![img_1.png](assets/scr_pgadmin1.png)

Every service in the cluster has their own database, but for the sake of simplicity, they are hosted in one Postgres
server. We will show in [later sections](#4-improving-the-setup), how the databases can be segregated out. Feel free to
inspect all the databases and tables, but there is not much data in there yet. There is just a few automatically seeded
assets, policies and contract definitions.

> Please be aware that among the list of databases, there is one named "trudy" which is designated for a new participant named Trudy. You can refer [here](./docs/Trudy%20Connector%20Tutorial.md) for additional information about adding this new participant.

### Verify your local installation

In order to check that the connectors were deployed successfully, please execute the following commands in a shell:

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost/bob/health/api/check/liveness
curl -X GET http://localhost/alice/health/api/check/liveness
```

which should return something similar to this, the important part being the `isSystemHealthy: true` bit:

```json
{
  "componentResults": [
    {
      "failure": null,
      "component": "Observability API",
      "isHealthy": true
    },
    {
      "failure": null,
      "component": null,
      "isHealthy": true
    }
  ],
  "isSystemHealthy": true
}
```

Once we've established the basic readiness of our connectors, we can move on to inspect a few data items:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost/bob/management/v3/assets/request -H "x-api-key: password" -H "content-type: application/json" | jq
```

this queries the `/assets` endpoint returning the entire list of assets that `bob` currently maintains. You should see
something like

```json
[
  {
    "@id": "1",
    "@type": "edc:Asset",
    "edc:properties": {
      "edc:description": "Product EDC Demo Asset 1",
      "edc:id": "1"
    },
    "edc:dataAddress": {
      "@type": "edc:DataAddress",
      "edc:type": "HttpData",
      "edc:baseUrl": "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos"
    },
    "@context": {
      "dct": "https://purl.org/dc/terms/",
      "tx": "https://w3id.org/tractusx/v0.0.1/ns/",
      "edc": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/",
      "dcat": "https://www.w3.org/ns/dcat/",
      "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/",
      "dspace": "https://w3id.org/dspace/v0.8/"
    }
  },
  {
    "@id": "2",
    "@type": "edc:Asset",
    "edc:properties": {
      "edc:description": "Product EDC Demo Asset 2",
      "edc:id": "2"
    },
    "edc:dataAddress": {
      "@type": "edc:DataAddress",
      "edc:type": "HttpData",
      "edc:baseUrl": "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos"
    },
    "@context": {
      "dct": "https://purl.org/dc/terms/",
      "tx": "https://w3id.org/tractusx/v0.0.1/ns/",
      "edc": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/",
      "dcat": "https://www.w3.org/ns/dcat/",
      "odrl": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/",
      "dspace": "https://w3id.org/dspace/v0.8/"
    }
  }
]
```

Note: the same thing can be done to inspect policies and contract definitions. The respective `curl` commands are:

```shell
# policies:
curl -X POST http://localhost/bob/management/v2/policydefinitions/request -H "x-api-key: password" -H "content-type: application/json" | jq
# contract defs:
curl -X POST http://localhost/bob/management/v2/contractdefinitions/request -H "x-api-key: password" -H "content-type: application/json" | jq
```

## 4. Improving the setup

Improvements can be made to these aspects:

- separate out databases: deploy one Postgres per connector, plus one Postgres each for MIW and KC
- add ingresses for all the various connector endpoints, MIW and Keycloak
