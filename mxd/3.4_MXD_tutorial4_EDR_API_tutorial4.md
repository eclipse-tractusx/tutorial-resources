# Exchange data using APIs

In this tutorial Bob wants to consume data (asset name) from Alice. Bob as the data consumer requests a contract offer using the **management API**.

| ID          | 4                                                                                            |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Description | Tractus-X EDC Second Asset with Access Policy                                                |
| Type        | HttpData                                                                                     |

Action (Bob): Request Alice's data asset (asset name) with the following postman prompt:

```shell
@Code
```

Story: The data transfer is unsuccessful. @Hemant: Where can Bob see what happend?

Action (Bob): Check logs/protocol/ transfer history

```shell
@Code
```

Maybe add a first step where Alice creates a contract offer using (asset name) using postman. Start Bob's steps afterwards. Result: transfer failed. Analysis with postan possible? If so, state result.

Show second option using EDR API to access the asset, combining the two steps of contract negotiation and transfer initiation. Process fails again, but EDR API shows what the problem is. Problem identified: data sink endpoint missing/wrong. Solution add the correct data sink endpoint, initiate transfer again. Recieve and display sent data.
