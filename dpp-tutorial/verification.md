## Certification Section

### 1Â° Create Certified Data Credentials (CDC)


#### Get Digital Twin Id
- Get the `<DIGITAL_TWIN_ID_BASE64_ENCODED>` from step 2.2.2 from this [Insomnia collection](./resources/explorer_payload/01%20Tractus-X%20Community%20Days.postman_collection.json) and store it in notepad editor for later use.

#### Get Submodel Id
- Search for the `digitalProductPass` keyword from the existing digital twin submodel

- Encode the submodel Id using this <a href="https://www.base64encode.org/Base64" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Encoder</a> and store it in notepad editor for later use

> [!TIP]
> Use Ctrl + F for searching

Navigate to the DPP-Verification directory in insomnia and follow the steps

### Step 1.1 Get the Submodel

- Substitute `<DIGITAL_TWIN_ID_BASE64_ENCODED>` with base64 encoded Digital Twin Id from [here](#get-digital-twin-id).

- Substitute `<DIGITAL_TWIN_SUBMODEL_ID_BASE64_ENCODED>` with base64 encoded Id from [here](#get-submodel-id).

- Substitute `<DIGITAL_TWIN_REGISTRY_URL>` with its value from the given paper.

- Execute the API call.

Example Response:
```json
{
	"endpoints": [
		{
			"interface": "SUBMODEL-3.0",
			"protocolInformation": {
				...
			}
		}
	],
	"idShort": "digitalProductPass",
	"id": "urn:uuid:1a6c2d40-14de-4bb3-8aee-d5f7f01f49e3",
	"semanticId": {
		"type": "ExternalReference",
		"keys": [
			{
				"type": "Submodel",
				"value": "urn:samm:io.catenax.generic.digital_product_passport:5.0.0#DigitalProductPassport"
			}
		]
	},
	"description": [
		{
			"language": "en",
			"text": "Digital Product Pass Submodel"
		}
	],
	"displayName": []
}

```

### Step 1.2 Update the Submodel

- Copy the response from [step 1.1](#step-11-get-the-submodel)

- Paste the response in step 1.2 and replace `<PASTE_RESPONSE_FROM_STEP_1.1>` in Insomnia collection

- Search for the `supplementalSemanticId` and delete the entire line

- Search for the `semanticId` and update it with the following json content:

```json
{
    "type": "ExternalReference",
    "keys": [
        {
            "type": "Submodel",
            "value": "urn:samm:io.catenax.generic.digital_product_passport:5.0.0#DigitalProductPassport"
        },
        {
            "type": "Operation",
            "value": "https://w3c.github.io/vc-jws-2020/contexts/v1/"
        },
        {
            "type": "DataElement",
            "value": "urn:samm:io.catenax.dpp_verification.cdc:1.0.0#CertifiedDataCredential"
        },
        {
            "type": "Entity",
            "value": "https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2"
        }
    ]
}
```

- Substitute `<DIGITAL_TWIN_ID_BASE64_ENCODED>` with base64 encoded Digital Twin Id from [here](#get-digital-twin-id).

- Substitute `<DIGITAL_TWIN_SUBMODEL_ID_BASE64_ENCODED>` with base64 encoded Id from [here](#get-submodel-id).

- Substitute `<DIGITAL_TWIN_REGISTRY_URL>` with its value from the given paper.

- Execute the API call.

### Step 1.3 Issue the Verifiable Credentials

- Copy the DPP aspect model which you created at the beginning at the aspect model creation step (Step 2.1.1 for Explorers) and replace `<DPP_JSON_PAYLOAD_OBJECT>` with the payload that you copied.

- Substitute `<DPP_PROVIDER_WALLET_URL>` with its value given in a paper.

- Execute the API call.


### Step 1.4 Verify the Proof

- Copy the JSON response from the API Step 1.3 in insomnia collection

- Paste the response and replace `<PASTE_RESPONSE_FROM_STEP_1.4>`

- Execute the API call.

If everything works, you will get the following response: 

```json
{
	"message": "Verified Credential is Valid! The proof was verified!",
	"verified": true
}
```

- To see the proof in the application, scan the QR code again or introduce ID in the app.

## Step 1.5 Store the Certified Digital Product Passport

Now that you have successfully managed to `issue/certify a Digital Product Passport` in an own wallet as a provider role and `Verify the integrity of the Digital Product Passport` from a consumer role, also using an own consumer wallet, you shall update the JSON at the data storage:

- Copy the API response from the Step 1.3 and replace `<PASTE_RESPONSE_FROM_STEP_1.3>` with the payload that you copied.

- Substitute the URL placeholders: `<DATA_SERVICE_URL>` from the given paper and `<digitalTwinSubmodelId>` which was used in step 2.1.1 in the collection

- Execute the API call.

Congratulations! You have successfully certified your Digital Product Passport and updated it in the data storage.

Please go back to the [Phase 3 at the main README guide](../README.md#phase-3-data-certification--verification), and scan again your QR code to see the verification status at the application.
